/*Create a repl called Lab4. This is an IncomeTaxCalculator that calculates taxes for 10 individuals.
The progressive income tax rate is mandated as follows:
Taxable Income 	Rate (%)
First $20,000 	0
Next $20,000 	10
Next $20,000 	20
The remaining 	30
For example, suppose that the taxable income is $85000, the income tax payable is $20000*0% + $20000*10% + $20000*20% + $25000*30%.
Write a program that reads the taxable income (in int). The program shall calculate the income tax payable (in double); and print the result rounded to 2 decimal places. Use loops to calculate IncomeTax for 10 people.
1. For 10 people,
a) accept income
b) calculate tax
c) display calculated income tax for that person
if anyone enters income as less than or equal to 0, skip the remaining logic and move on to the next person (use continue).
